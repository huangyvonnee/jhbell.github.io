October is always an interesting month at the University level. For most,
this is the time when school really starts. Students are facing their first
round of midterms with little relief on the amount of homework they have due.
I find that the month of October is particularly challenging to first-year
students, many of whom have never had a proper midterm exam before.

I have always thought it is very important to stop and take a moment to reflect
on this month. It's all too easy to get swept away in all the work that
continues to pile up.
