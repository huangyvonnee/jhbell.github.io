October is always an interesting month at the University. For most,
this is the time when school really starts. Students are facing their first
round of midterms with little relief on the amount of homework they have due.
I find that the month of October is particularly challenging to first-year
students, many of whom have never had a proper midterm exam before.

It is very important to stop and take a moment to reflect this month. It's all 
too easy to get swept away in all the work that continues to pile up. The
following are a few things I have found help to ground me as school gets more
difficult.

## Find a way to relax.

Figure out something that you can do that helps to take your mind off of 
school, work, and all of the "bad" things going on. For me, I play music. I 
have been playing guitar for a long time now, and have been in the Longhorn 
Band during my 4 years at UT. 

Music helps me relax and calm my mind. It demands my attention, so I am still
focused, but when I'm playing I try not to set expectations and simply lose
myself in the music. Sometimes this is me laying on my bed, guitar in hand,
piddling around playing nothing in particular. Other times it is me browsing
the internet listening to some 1940's big band music. Regardless, I am engaging
myself with the song, rather than passivley having it in the background.

I want to make it clear that this is different from practicing. While 
I can say that I definitely love learning a new song and working hard to 
make every note perfect, it is just as valuable to take a time to do what you
know.

For example, I've recently been trying to learn the guitar solo in
[Renegade by Styx][renegade] which, if you haven't heard before, is fantastic
but also fantastically difficult. There's something about slowing down a solo
like that, and taking it one measure at a time that is really satisfying. In
thirty minutes I can go from knowing nothing to being able to play a few
bars at almost full tempo. While this is incredibly satisfying, it's also a
ton of work. Whenever I'm stressed, I find it much more productive (to my sanity
at least) to turn on a [jazz backing track][backing-track] and make up my own 
solo.

## Keep your fun things fun.

There's a time for work, and a time for play. I'm sure you've heard this a
million times, but I can't stress enough how valuable it is to give yourself
a break.ff of all the chaos of school
