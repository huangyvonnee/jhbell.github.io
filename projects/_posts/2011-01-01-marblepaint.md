This project was my first Android application I helped build. Back in 2011 I
worked with a friend of mine, Matt Laux, to create an android application that
simulated drawing with a marble dipped in paint. The idea was to have a blank
canvas on the screen and a colored marble. When you tilt the device, the
marble rolls around on the screen leaving behind a trail of color.

Most of my programming experience throughout high school consisted of me
piddling around making things that no one would ever use. It was a really neat
experience for me to finally work on a larger project and get a usable
product as a result. 

Overall, creating the app was a pretty crazy experience for me. I was decent at
Java and I understood how a basic game loop works. I had never really made a
shippable project before this app. I think the most valuable
thing I got out of the project was how to code with other people. 

# What is MarblePaint?

MarblePaint is a mobile drawing application for Android devices. However, in
order to draw, you must tilt your device to move a marble around the screen
which in turn leaves behind a trail of paint. I got the idea from an art
project I had way back in elementary school, where we dipped marbles in paint
and rolled them around in a tray across a sheet of paper.

Matt and I were able to successfully create and publish MarblePaint to the
Android market where it received over 10,000 installs.

# What I Did

The majority of what I worked consisted of creating a realistic motion for
rolling the marble, and all of the art for the app. I believe I used Photoshop
Elements to create all of the image assets for MarblePaint. For the physics
programming, I actually did some research to figure out how a marble actually
rolls. After getting the basic movement, there was a lot of tweaking involved
to get it to feel natural when you tilt the device.

The app was originally designed for Android 2.7. After a year we stopped
providing updates, and the app is no longer in the market. This post is one
of a few that I am putting on the site to mark projects that I have completed
in the past. The date on the post does not necessarily reflect when the
project was done.
