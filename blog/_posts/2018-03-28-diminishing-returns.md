Our recent work on the game has begun to remind me of the law of diminishing
returns. In this post I talk about where the game is and where we are looking
to end up in the next few weeks.

# The Game

This week is a transition between our Pre-Alpha and Alpha releases. As a
personal goal, our group decided to make our weekly sprint about "Building a
Complete Game". This means that for our sprint review, we will have a game with
four puzzles and when you complete the puzzles you beat the game. The other
side of this sprint is trying to make the game *feel* complete. There may be
gaps in functionality or in the world, but for the most part, it should feel
like the game can be played from start to finish.

The key thing missing from our game was the gate.

In order to complete the game, the player must complete the four main puzzles.
When the player completes a puzzle, the corresponding token on the gate lights
up. Once all puzzles have been completed, the player can walk through the gate
into a new scene showing the end of the game.

There has also been a lot of refinement to the individual puzzles in the game.
Each one now has a glowing marker to signify where it is, and each one has been
tested significantly. Overall, I am pretty happy with how the sprint ended up!
I think if anything can be said, it feels like we have an actual game now which
is very rewarding.

# Diminishing Returns

As we have gotten further into the project, I have noticed something that
reminds me a lot of "The Law of Diminishing Returns". The law basically states
there is a point where the amount of energy or money you put into something
outweighs the benefit you receive from it.

I think this has come very clearly into perspective over the past few weeks
while working on the game. As we have gotten nearer to the completion of the
game, the same amount of works seem to make less of a difference in the way
the game plays.

For example, early on, 3 hours of work on Zen Juice meant something like adding
movement to the game. By working on the game for just 3 hours, the player could
now move around. This is a *major* improvement to the game and was really
satisfying to see implemented. While an update to the game could still take 3
hours, at this point in development, those three hours of work could be spent
fine tuning colliders for an individual puzzle.

This isn't to say that that work is not as important, it's just to say that it
doesn't seem like a lot was accomplished comparatively. I think this has
contributed to a little bit of a slump in the group the past few weeks. 

This week was a great change of pace. I think dedicating our time towards
finishing a complete line of the game was a good idea. Now that we are nearing
the end of our time constraint, our team is feeling good about the scope of our
game and our ability to finish it in time. Next week we have our Alpha release
and should be shipping a pretty finished product, but until then, happy
hacking!
