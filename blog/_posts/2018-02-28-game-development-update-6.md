This week we took a step back and took a new approach to the game. While we
have been consistently making progress, we got off track in terms of the design
of the game. It was time to sit down and rethink our design and the things that
make our game fun.

# The Tutorial

Last week, we completed a tutorial level for our game. Based on the feedback
from our play testers, we learned very quickly that our approach was not
adding much to the "fun" of our game.

The largest issue with our tutorial was that it had _way_ too much text. The
text also scrolled too quickly, so players who were actually interested in
reading everything didn't always get the chance. On top of that, the tutorial
was loosely bounded, allowing the player to walk right past the tutorial if
they want.

The problem with this was players would

1. Walk right past the tutorial
2. Not know how to play the game
3. Not know what to do
4. Not have fun

So we had to do a large redesign this past weekend. We decided on a few key
things to drive our game forward in the coming weeks.

# The Redesign

Our new approach is to abandon a linear kind of game play. Our game will start
with a **strict** tutorial, which forces the player to demonstrate the
capability of playing the game. This will be similar in structure to before,
but will have less text and less mobility for the player. For example, we may
limit _any_ movement by the player until they can pick up an object and put it
in a crate.

The tutorial will conclude with turning on the lighthouse, one of the four main
objectives of the game. Upon completion of all four objectives, the player
unlocks a gate to the mountain, ending the game. The difference here is that
we are no longer forcing the order of completion of the events. The player will
have all of their abilities from the start, and can complete the tasks in
any order they see fit.

Our hope is that this will increase the ability for the player to explore. Our
mechanics in the game are really fun to just play around with, but can be
frustrating when you have to use them for a specific task. Allowing the player
to be on their own and do things the way they want to will hopefully provide
opportunity to play more with the mechanics and make the game more enjoyable.

Now that we have a solid foundation for our game, we are starting to get more
and more into details which can all make a huge difference in the way the game
plays. Next week I am planning on going in depth into one of the objectives I
created this week. It required some clever thinking and the result is pretty
awesome. Until then, happy Hacking!
